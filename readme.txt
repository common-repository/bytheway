ByTheWay is a WordPress plugin providing shortcodes for collapsable annotations.

== Description ==

ByTheWay is a WordPress plugin providing shortcodes for collapsable annotations. Have a look at the [ByTheWay showcase gallery](http://btw.wechselberger.org/category/showcase) to get an idea of what is possible with ByTheWay.

= Simple =
ByTheWay is easy to use. ByTheWay supports nested annotations just by repeating the same shortcode.

= Flexible =
ByTheWay supports several optional attributes, providing a great deal of flexibility. You can change attributes per single annotation or by globally adjusting default attribute values in the admin backend. You can even use your own CSS styles.

= Clean and Lightweight =
On the client side, ByTheWay uses the jquery libraries coming with WordPress 3.6.1. So don't worry about conflicting libraries or wasted bandwith. On the server side, ByTheWay makes efficient use of resources â€“ it should run quick even on shared webhosting and small servers.

== Installation ==

1. Either install ByTheWay using the built-in WordPress plugin installer. Or upload all the folders and files in the zipfile to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Screenshots ==

1. Source coude of some basic shortcode usage.

== Changelog ==
